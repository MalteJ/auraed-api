# API

Like system calls -- but for platform teams.

### Runtime 

The runtime subsystem is where process execution happens. Regardless if its a regular old process, a container, or a virtual machine, it happens here.

### Schedule

Here is where we have taken the most useful aspects of systemd, and Kubernetes and combined them into a simplified subsystem designed to help you keep
you applications running just the way you want them.

### Core 

We hate junk drawers, but we do need some basics that work everywhere. Here you will find things like a status update, naming, labelling, and trait development.
