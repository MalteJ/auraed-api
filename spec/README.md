# Aurae API Specification

| Current Version | v1 |
|-----------------|----|

Here lives the current API specification for the current version of the Aurae API.

### Proposing a New Subsystem

1. Copy `_subsystem.md` and replace the string `_subsystem` with the new name of your proposed subsystem.
2. Spend time (perhaps using hackmd or a google doc) building out your subsystem definition. Be as detailed as possible.
3. Open a pull request with the new proposal against this repository. 

For example if you wanted to propose a new subsystem called `boops` you would copy `_systemd.md` to `boops.md` and fille out the new file.

### Requesting a Change (RFC) to an existing subsystem 

1. Copy the existing subsystem.md to a new file using an apropriate semantic version number of the subsystem givin the impact of your change. For example `boops.md` could be `boops.0.1.0.md` if your change was a breaking change.
2. Spend time (perhaps using hackmd or a google doc) building out your subsystem definition. Be as detailed as possible.
3. Open a pull request with the new proposal against this repository.
